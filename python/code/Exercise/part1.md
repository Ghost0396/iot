# Part 1: Syntax and Semantics

## Exercise 1: Data Types

Identify the data type of the following values:

    "Python"
    15
    9.8
    True
    [1, 2, 3]

## Exercise 2: Arithmetic Operators

Calculate the following using Python's arithmetic operators:

    The sum of 15 and 32.
    The difference when 94 is subtracted from 100.
    The product of 12 and 3.

## Exercise 3: Type Conversion

Convert the following:

    The integer 64 to a float.
    The float 22.5 to an integer.
    The string "1234" to an integer.
    The number 50 to a string.

## Exercise 4: Basic String Methods

Given the string "hello world", perform the following:

    Capitalize the first letter.
    Convert the entire string to uppercase.
    Replace "world" with "Python".
    Find the index of the first occurrence of l.

## Exercise 5: Using format() Method

Use the format() method to insert the numbers 20 and 30 into this sentence:

    "These two numbers are {} and {}."

## Exercise 6: Concatenation and Repetition

    Concatenate the strings "Python" and "Programming".
    Repeat the string "Python" 3 times.

## Exercise 7: String Slicing

Given the string "Data Science", extract:

    "Data".
    "Science".

## Exercise 8: Checking Type

Write a Python script to check the type of the variable assigned with the value:

    "100" and 100.

## Exercise 9: Arithmetic and Strings

Given the string "100", convert it to an integer and add 50 to it.

## Exercise 10: String Length

Find the length of the string 
    
    "Learning Python is fun!".

## Exercise 11: Finding Substrings

Check if "Python" is present in the string 
    
    "Learning Python is interesting.".

## Exercise 12: Splitting Strings

Split the string 
    
    "Python-Data-Science" 

by the delimiter "-".
