# Tuples

## Exercise 1: Tuple Creation and Access

    1. Create a tuple named colors containing at least 4 different color names as strings.
    
    2. Print the first and last color in the tuple.

    3. Create a new tuple mixed that combines colors with another tuple of your choice containing different types of data (e.g., numbers, strings).


## Exercise 2: Tuples and Looping

    Given the tuple numbers = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50), write a loop that iterates through the tuple and prints each value.

## Exercise 3: Tuple Unpacking

    1. Create a tuple person_info containing a name, age, and country.
    2. Unpack these values into variables name, age, and country respectively, and print them.

## Exercise 4: Searching in Tuples

    1. Given a tuple items = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"), write a program that checks if "banana" is in items.
    2. If "banana" is found, print its index in the tuple.

## Exercise 5: Tuple Methods

    1. Create a tuple numbers with some repeated elements (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 2).
    2. Use a tuple method to count how many times the number 2 appears in the tuple.
    3. Find the index of the first occurrence of the number 4.
