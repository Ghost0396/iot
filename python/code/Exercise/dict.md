# Dictionaries

## 1: Creating and Accessing a Dictionary

    1. Create a dictionary named person with keys name, age, and city and assign appropriate values to them.
    2. Print the value of the name from the dictionary.
    3. Update the age of the person to 30.
    4. Add a new key-value pair email with the value person@example.com.

## 2: Iterating Over a Dictionary

    1. Given a dictionary scores with student names as keys and their scores as values, write a program that prints each student's name and their score line by line.

scores = {"John": 88, "Emily": 92, "Alex": 93}

## 3: Merging Two Dictionaries

    1. Given two dictionaries, dict1 = {'a': 100, 'b': 200} and dict2 = {'x': 300, 'y': 200}, merge them into a new dictionary.

## 4: Filtering Items in a Dictionary

    1. Given a dictionary product_prices = {'apple': 1.5, 'banana': 0.5, 'orange': 0.8, 'grape': 2.0}, write a program that creates a new dictionary with only items that have a price greater than 1.0.

## 5: Nested Dictionaries

    1. Assume you have a nested dictionary representing stock information for different products in a store. Each product has name, price, and quantity keys. Write a program that increases the price of each product by 10%.


products = {
    1: {'name': 'pen', 'price': 1.20, 'quantity': 100},
    2: {'name': 'pencil', 'price': 0.80, 'quantity': 200},
    3: {'name': 'notebook', 'price': 2.00, 'quantity': 50},
}

## 6: Dictionary from User Input

    1. Write a program that asks the user to enter names and favorite colors (e.g., John:blue), separated by a colon. Store these pairs in a dictionary, and then print the dictionary. Assume the input ends when the user enters "done".

## 7. Counting with Dictionaries

    Given a string, count how many times each character appears and store the counts in a dictionary. For example, given the string "hello", the result should be {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}.

## 8. Inverting a Dictionary

    Write a function that inverts a dictionary, swapping keys and values. Assume that the original dictionary's values are unique. For example, if the input is {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, the output should be {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}.
