# if Statement

## Exercise 1: Basic if Statement

Write a Python program to check if a number is positive. If the number is positive, print "Positive number".

## Exercise 2: if-else Statement

Extend the first exercise to also check if the number is negative or zero. If the number is negative, print "Negative number", otherwise print "Zero".

## Exercise 3: Nested if Statements

Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input and prints the largest number. Use nested if statements.

## Exercise 4: if Statements with Logical Operators

Write a program that checks if a number is within a given range (inclusive). The range is 1 to 10. If the number is within the range, print "Number is within the range", otherwise print "Number is outside the range".
