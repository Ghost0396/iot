# Constructor

## Exercise 1: Basic Constructor Implementation

Task: Create a Python class named Book that has two attributes: title and author. Write an __init__ constructor method for the class that initializes these attributes. Then, create an instance of this class and print out the attributes to verify they are set correctly.

## Exercise 2: Parameterized Constructor with Default Values

Task: Define a Python class named Rectangle. It should have two attributes: length and width. Implement an __init__ constructor with default values length=1 and width=1 for these attributes. Also, add a method area that calculates and returns the rectangle's area. Create two instances of this class: one with the default parameters and another with custom parameters. Print the area of both instances.

## Exercise 3: Constructor with Validation

Task: Create a class Person with two attributes: name and age. The constructor should validate that age is an integer and greater than 0; if not, raise a ValueError with an appropriate message. If the name is not a string or is empty, raise a ValueError as well. After implementing the class, write code to create instances to demonstrate both successful creation and error handling.
